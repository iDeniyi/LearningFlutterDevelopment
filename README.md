# LearningFlutterDevelopment
My journey learning how to develop applications using Flutter.
Each application created has its own branch within the repository.

Application(s) created:
  * BusinessCardApp - trivial app learning how to use different widgets in Flutter, especially Card, ListTile, Column, Row, CircleAvatar.
  * Dicey - a trivial app with 2 die that change their faces when either die is tapped.
  * XylophoneApp - an app tht aplays the basic music notes on the tap of the keys.
